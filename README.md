I have created a Machine learnig model using thae datd of US taxi data fetched from opendataorg. the data consists of 16 lakh rows for the year 2019. The Ml model takes the input from the user based on  features like pickup location, drop location, day, month, hour and then predicts the taxi fare amount. We have used xgboost  model for this and evaluation metrics of out model are :- R2 score: 0.82 , RMSE :  6.2 , MSE : 36.3
